## Task 1
Analyze the auth.log. What is the IP address used by the attacker to carry out a brute force attack?  
回答「65.2.161.68」
```sh
└─$ grep -E -o "([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" auth.log | sort | uniq -c
      1 172.31.35.28
      1 203.101.190.9
    214 65.2.161.68
```


## Task 2
The bruteforce attempts were successful and attacker gained access to an account on the server. What is the username of the account?  
回答「root」
```sh
└─$ grep -E "([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" auth.log | grep -i "accept"

```


## Task 3
Identify the timestamp when the attacker logged in manually to the server to carry out their objectives. The login time will be different than the authentication time, and can be found in the wtmp artifact.

## Task 5
The attacker added a new user as part of their persistence strategy on the server and gave this new user account higher privileges. What is the name of this account?  
回答「cyberjunkie」
```sh
└─$ grep "useradd" auth.log
